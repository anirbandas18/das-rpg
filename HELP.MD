* Enter option C to create a new character. You will be asked to enter the player name and the game will assign you a random character type
* Enter option S to save the game at the current state of the character
* Enter option R to resume the game from the last saved state of the character
* Enter option X to exit the game

## How the game behaves?

* Progress is measured by creating a character to explore and fighting enemies to gain experience
* Creating a new character resets previous progress with any other character
* Exploration is only possible by moving one step at a time in any direction until the edge of the map
* Game should be explicitly saved otherwise progress will be lost as no auto save is enabled
